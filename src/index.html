                  Arsène Wenger joined Arsenal in October 1996 after successful runs at Ligue 1 side Monaco and Grampus Eight in the J. League as the Club's first non-British manager. Arsenal finished third in Arsene's first season in charge, but didn't take long to taste success in his second. Arsenal capped of the 1997/98 season with a Premier League title and FA Cup Trophy, winning the English Double. Arsène saught to transform the way the Gunner's played on the pitch, but also improved the players' lives outside of the game. This was only the beginning for Arsène's impressive tenure at Arsenal.

                      Arsène Wenger led Arsenal through a stretch that is unlikely to be duplicated by the Club again. From 2001 to 2006 Arsenal won the League twice (01/02 &amp 03/04), FA Cup three times (02, 03 &amp 05), and made a UEFA Champions League Final appearance in 2006 against Barcelona. Arsenal also put together the longest run of games without defeat in English football history, 49 games (36 won and 13 drawn). One important aspect to note about this run is the overall competiveness of the Premier League during this time. Not only did Arsène's team need to bring a winning mentality each game, but they had to do against teams like Manchester United, Chelsea, and Liverpool who were also very successful in their own right at that time.

                      During this time Arsène managed some of the Club's most iconic stars including Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Viera, Robert Pires, Freddy Ljunberg, Cesc Fabregas, Robin Van Persie, and many, many more. Not only did Arsène manage some very talented players, but he was also courageous enough to take risks on lesser known players that made big impacts for Arsenal throughout Arsène's tenure. Arsène's teams during this time were known for their smooth attacking style and athleticism. This beautiful style of play was a hallmark for Arsène's teams while at Arsenal.

                    Arsène's Arsenal squad played their last match at Highbury on May 7th, 2006. A 4-2 win over Wigan. Going forward Arsenal would make Emirates Stadium their new home. Not only was this change expected to be a great move for the Club, but it was also intended to catapult the team to the next level of European excellence.

                    Since moving to the Emirates Stadium Arsenal have put together many promising campaigns, but have failed to replicate the successes of past during the Club's time at Highbury. With hindsight being 20/20 it is safe to say that the move to the Emirates has not yielded the desired results in terms of wins and losses.

                  Arsène Wenger is the longest serving and most successful manager in the history of Arsenal. In many ways Arsenal reflect Arsène's personality, from the way the team plays to the construction of the training facility. Arsène was the key influencer in shaping the Club's progression and transformation over the past two decades. In 2018, after 22 years at the Club, Arsène decided to step down as manager. Although it was sad to see the Legend step away from the Club that helped bring to English and European excellence, it was time for a change. The players, the Club, and the fans were all ready for a change. Since Arsène's departure, Arsenal has struggled to regain consistent form. Regardless of how Arsenal progresses moving forward Arsène made an impact on the Club that will never be forgotten.
